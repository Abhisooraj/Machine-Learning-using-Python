# Classificationüè´: 

A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values. Given one or more inputs, a classification model will try to
predict the value of one or more outcomes. Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are 
sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) 
from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).
Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets also provided with the input data. There are many 
applications in classification in many domains such as in credit approval, medical diagnosis, target marketing etc.

<h2> Confusion Matrix </h2> 
A Confusion Matrix also known as an error matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or ‚Äúclassifier‚Äù) on a set of test data for which the true values are known. 
It allows the visualization of the performance of an algorithm.

<h2> AUC (Area Under The Curve) ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve.</h2>
The AUC - ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes.

Higher the AUC, better the model is at predicting 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. By analogy, Higher the AUC, better the model is at distinguishing between patients with disease and no disease.

The ROC curve is plotted with TPR against the FPR where TPR is on y-axis and FPR is on the x-axis
