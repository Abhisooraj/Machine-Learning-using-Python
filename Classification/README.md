# Classification: 

A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values. Given one or more inputs, a classification model will try to
predict the value of one or more outcomes. Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points. Classes are 
sometimes called as targets/ labels or categories. Classification predictive modeling is the task of approximating a mapping function (f) 
from input variables (X) to discrete output variables (y).
Classification belongs to the category of supervised learning where the targets also provided with the input data. There are many 
applications in classification in many domains such as in credit approval, medical diagnosis, target marketing etc.
