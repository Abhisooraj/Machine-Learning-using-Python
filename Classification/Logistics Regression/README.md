# Logistics Regression 
It is a statistical method for analyzing a data set in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. 
The outcome is measured with a $dichotomous$ variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes). 
<br>
<br>
The goal of logistic regression is to find the bestfitting model to describe the relationship between the dichotomous characteristic of 
interest ( dependent variable = response or outcome variable) and a set of independent (predictor or explanatory) variables.

<b>Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are the two famous Machine Learning Algorithms. The Linear Regression is used for solving 
Regression problems whereas Logistic Regression is used for solving the Classification problems.</b>
