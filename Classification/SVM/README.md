# Support Vector Machine:
SVM is Supervised machine learning algorithm used for <b>classification</b> but it can be used also for <b>regression.</b> The objective of the Support Vector Machine  algorithm is to find a hyperplane in an N- dimensional space (N â€” the number of features) 
that distinctly classifies the data points. To separate the two classes of data points, many possible hyperplanes could be chosen. 
Our objective is to find a plane that has the maximum margin, i.e the maximum distance between data points of both classes. 
Maximizing the margin distance provides some reinforcement so that future data points can be classified with more confidence.

SVM is based on maximizing the margin and thereby creating the largest possible distance between the separating hyperplane and 
the instances to reduce an upper bound on the expected generalization error. Some instances of the training dataset called
Support vectors, which are close to the separating hyperplane and provide the most useful information for classification, 
are utilized in SVM training.

In addition, an appropriate kernel function is used to transform the data into a high-dimension to use linear discriminate functions.
