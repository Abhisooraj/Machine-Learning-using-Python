# Machine-Learning-using-Python-
A tutorial of Machine Learning using Python Programming language
<b>Machine learning</b>, the application and science of algorithms that make sense of data, is the most exciting field of all the computer sciences! We are living in an age where data comes in abundance; using self-learning algorithms from the field of machine learning, we can turn this data into knowledge. 
<br/>
Thanks to the many powerful open source libraries that have been develop in recent years, there has probably never been a better time to break into the Machine-learning field and learn how to utilize powerful algorithms to spot patterns in data and make predictions about
future events.
<br/>
In this age of modern technology, there is one resource, which we have in abundance: a large amount of Structured and Unstructured data. In the second half of the twentieth century, machine learning evolved as a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that involved self-learning algorithms that derived knowledge from data in order to make predictions. Instead of requiring humans to manually derive rules and build models from analyzing large amounts of data, the Machine learning offers a more efficient alternative for capturing the knowledge in data to gradually improve the performance of predictive models and make data-driven decisions.

   <b>Three types of machine learning:</b> 
      <li>  1. Supervised learning  </li>
      <li>  2. Unsupervised learning  </li>
      <li>  3. Reinforcement learning. </li>
</ul>

<b>1. Supervised learning </b>
The main goal in supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data. Here, the term supervised refers to a set of samples where the desired output signals (labels) already known. Considering the example of email spam filtering, we can train a model using a supervised machine-learning algorithm on a corpus of labeled emails, emails that are correctly marked as spam or not-spam, to predict whether a new email belongs to of the two categories. 

<b>2. Unsupervised learning </b>
In unsupervised learning, however, we are dealing with unlabeled data or data of unknown structure. Using unsupervised learning techniques, we are able to explore the structure of our data to extract meaningful information without the guidance of a known outcome variable or reward function. 
<br/>Clustering is an exploratory data analysis technique that allows us to organize a pile of information into meaningful subgroups (clusters) without having any prior knowledge of their group memberships. Each cluster that arises during the analysis defines a group of objects that share a certain degree of similarity but are more dissimilar to objects in other clusters, which is why clustering sometimes knows as unsupervised classification. 
<br/>
Clustering is a great technique for structuring information and deriving meaningful relationships from data. For example, it allows marketers to discover customer groups based on their interests, in order to develop distinct marketing programs.

<b>3. Reinforcement learning </b>
In Reinforcement learning, the goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment. Since the information about the current state of the environment typically also includes a so-called reward signal, we can think of reinforcement learning as a field related to supervised learning. 
<br/>
However, in reinforcement learning this feedback is not the correct ground truth label or value, but a measure of how well the action was measure by a reward function. Through its interaction with the environment, an agent can then use reinforcement learning to learn a series of actions that maximizes this reward via an exploratory trial-and-error approach or deliberative planning. A popular example of reinforcement learning is a chess engine. Here, the agent decides upon a series of moves depending on the state of the board (the environment), and the reward can be define as win or lose at the end of the game.
